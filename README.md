### This React component, named Scene, renders an interactive scene with a cube that changes color and position when clicked. It utilizes the @react-spring/three package for 3D animations in React.

# Props of React Spring / useSpring:

from: Defines the initial state of the animation.

to: Defines the final state of the animation.

delay: Specifies a delay before starting the animation.

pause: Pauses the animation when the value changes to true.

config: Physics configuration of the animation, including mass, tension, and friction.

onStart: Function called when the animation starts.

onRest: Function called when the animation ends.

onPause: Function called when the animation is paused.

onResume: Function called when the animation is resumed.

### This code creates an animation where the cube moves horizontally and changes color between "hotpink" and "yellow". Clicking on the cube pauses the animation, and the console logs messages during different animation events.
